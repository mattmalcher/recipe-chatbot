    "    modified from: “madhur jaffrey’s world-of-the-east vegetarian cooking” these are delicious! the effort of making your own samosa crust, instead of buying phyllo dough, is well worth it. __________________________________________________________ samosas may be served at room temperature or they may be served warm. samosas may be made ahead of time (up to a day), refrigerated neatly in flat plastic containers, and then reheated in a 350 degree oven. if you wish to freeze samosas, fry them partially, drain them, and freeze them in a single layer in flat plastic containers. when you wish to eat them, defrost and fry them a second time.\n",
